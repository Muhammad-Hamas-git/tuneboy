# tuneboy
Tuneboy is a tiny, retro-styled music app that looks like an old CRT terminal and plays like a pocket synth. You can jam freely with the keyboard, build songs in a clean grid sequencer, and enjoy a cute 16×16 mascot named Bitbit who reacts to what you do. Small, fast, and a little nostalgic—perfect for quick ideas or messing around with sounds.
